# Zomato Data Analysis

This project analyzes Zomato restaurant data using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis covers various aspects of the dataset, including ratings distribution, type of restaurant, votes, and more.
## Libraries Used

- **Numpy:** With Numpy arrays, complex computations are executed quickly, and large calculations are handled efficiently.
- **Matplotlib:** It has a wide range of features for creating high-quality plots, charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more.
- **Pandas:** The library simplifies the loading of data frames into 2D arrays and provides functions for performing multiple analysis tasks in a single operation.
- **Seaborn:** It offers a high-level interface for creating visually appealing and informative statistical graphics.

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
